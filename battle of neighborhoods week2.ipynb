    "## Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Toronto is a large and ethnically diverse metropolis, with a high demand for foods from different cultures. For example, in Toronto there are restaurants belonging to different cuisines like French, Japanese, Indian, Mexican, etc. Moreover, since it is the financial capital of Canada, the city receives business people and tourists from all over the globe and they can visit many boroughs, as business and touristic attractions are widespread in Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "A famous French chef selected to open his new gourmet restaurant in Toronto, since in a big and important financial city like Toronto a gourmet restaurant may proper and attract high spenders. He, as the stakeholder, asked our company for the best neighborhood to open his restaurant. He explained that the neighborhood should have a high demand for French cuisine and should have an opportunity for a top restaurant to prosper. Since most boroughs of Toronto already have many restaurants and a high competition between them, it is highly important to open a new restaurant in a location that provides an advantage against competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "My boss asked our team to answer the question: \"Which neighborhood in Toronto is the best place to open a new top French restaurant?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "Since our stakeholder is looking to open up a French restaurant in Toronto, we will use and merge data from multiple resources, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Toronto neighborhoods data\n",
    "2.Restaurant data\n",
    "3.Venues data\n",
    "#### Toronto neighborhood dataset\n",
    "Data regarding Toronto neighborhoods were extracted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, where we can extract the features regarding the postal codes, borough and neighborhoods. Then, we add to the dataset neighborhood latitude and longitude that we can extracted from http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data. Therefore, this dataset defines which neighborhoods Toronto has, where they are located and where we should look for French restaurants to discover high demand locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Restaurant data\n",
    "In order to define neighborhoods with a high demand for French restaurants, we use the Foursquare API. From this API, we can extract the features: neighborhood, ID of the restaurant, name of the restaurant, number of Likes, rating and tips from French restaurants located in Toronto neighborhoods. Using this information, we can define neighborhoods with several French restaurants as having a high demand for French cuisine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Venues data\n",
    "After selecting a neighborhood based on high demand for a French restaurant, it is important to verify whether it provides a proper environment for a restaurant to thrive. Therefore, we collect information regarding venues in all neighborhoods and compare our selected neighborhood to all others to check for similarities. From this dataset we can extract the features name of the venue and venue category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using all datasets, we can analyze the data and select the best neighborhood to open a gourmet French restaurant in Toronto.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Discussions\n",
    "From all the neighborhoods in Toronto, only four have more than 10 French restaurants, which means that only four neighborhoods have a high demand for them. These neighborhoods are: 'Commerce Court, Victoria Hotel', 'St. James Town', 'Stn A PO Boxes 25 The Esplanade', 'Toronto Dominion Centre, Design Exchange'. After we calculated the average ratings for all French restaurants in these neighborhoods, we discovered that 'Stn A PO Boxes 25 The Esplanade' is the second in number of French restaurants (high demand), but the lowest average rating and the lowest number of high rated restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neighborhood 'Stn A PO Boxes 25 The Esplanade' seems like a good candidate, and we should confirm if it is a good neighborhood to open a restaurant by comparing it to other neighborhoods. Results demonstrate that the four neighborhoods with the highest demand for French restaurants are similar and were clustered together in cluster 1. Therefore, 'Stn A PO Boxes 25 The Esplanade' that has a high demand and the lowest average rating for French restaurants among them, is the best neighborhood to open a gourmet French restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "The problem proposed by the stakeholder was solved using data science. He wanted to find out the best place in Toronto to open a gourmet French restaurant based on high demand and a neighborhood that provide a good opportunity for his restaurant to grow and expand. From all the neighborhoods in Toronto, the best one is 'Stn A PO Boxes 25 The Esplanade' because it still has room for a restaurant with high ratings."
