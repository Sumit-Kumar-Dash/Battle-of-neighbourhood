Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods
Introduction
Toronto is a large and ethnically diverse metropolis, with a high demand for foods from different cultures. For example, in Toronto there are restaurants belonging to different cuisines like French, Japanese, Indian, Mexican, etc. Moreover, since it is the financial capital of Canada, a gourmet restaurant may proper and attract high spenders.

A famous French chef wants to open a gourmet restaurant in Toronto. He, as the stakeholder, asked our company for the best neighborhood to open his restaurant. He explained that the neighborhood should have a high demand for French cuisine and should have an opportunity for a top restaurant to prosper.

My boss asked our team to answer the question: "Which neighborhood in Toronto is the best place to open a new top French restaurant?"

Data
Data regarding Toronto neighborhoods were extracted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, where we can extract the features regarding the postal codes, borough and neighborhoods. Then, we add to the dataset neighborhood latitude and longitude that we can extracted from http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data. Therefore, this dataset defines which neighborhoods Toronto has and where we should look for French restaurants to discover high demand locations.

In order to define neighborhoods with a high demand for French restaurants, we use the Foursquare API. From this API, we can extract the features neighborhood, ID of the restaurant, name of the restaurant, number of Likes, rating and Tips from French restaurants. Using this information, we can define neighborhoods with several French restaurants as having a high demand for French cuisine.

Using the datasets composed of neighborhoods and French restaurants, we can analyze the data and select the best neighborhood to open a gourmet French restaurant in Toronto.
